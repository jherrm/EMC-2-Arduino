EMC 2 Arduino is a small collection of files intended to allow a person with
an Arduino Mega2560 (or UNO), an old USB enabled computer and a free copy of
LinuxCNC to begin building their very own CNC machine cheaply and quickly with
a variety of components, ranging from low-end inexpensive (even salvaged)
components such as old steppers and computer parts to high-end linear servos.

Right now We're just beginning, accepting advice, contributions of code and skill
as well as learning too.

	   Got ideas, tips, suggestions?
